Fix Socket IO connection issues by upgrading sanic to v21.12. 

The bug is caused by [an invalid function signature](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/issues/2272) and is fixed in [v21.12](https://sanic.readthedocs.io/en/v21.12.1/sanic/changelog.html#version-21-12-0).

This update brings some deprecations in `sanic`:

- Sanic and Blueprint may no longer have arbitrary properties attached to them
    - Fixed this by moving user defined properties to the `instance.ctx` object
- Sanic and Blueprint forced to have compliant names
    - Fixed this by using string literal names instead of the module's name via _\_name\_\_
- `sanic.exceptions.abort` is Deprecated
    - Fixed by replacing it with `sanic.exceptions.SanicException`
- `sanic.response.StreamingHTTPResponse` is deprecated
    - Fixed by replacing it with sanic.response.ResponseStream
