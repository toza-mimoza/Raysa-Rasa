Bump TensorFlow version to 2.7.

:::caution
We can't guarantee the exact same output and hence model performance if your 
configuration uses `LanguageModelFeaturizer`. This applies to the case where the 
model is re-trained with the new rasa open source version without changing the 
configuration, random seeds, and data as well as to the case where a model trained with 
a previous version of rasa open source is loaded with this new version for inference.

We suggest training a new model if you are upgrading to this version of Rasa Open Source.
